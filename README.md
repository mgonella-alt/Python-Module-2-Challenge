Senario
You’re employed by an investment firm called Investgenics. It specialises in financial data analytics for businesses. The firm provides potential investors with investment advice and planning. As a data consultant, you’ll need to perform an in-depth analysis of the data to formulate investment strategies for clients, helping the company to fulfil its needs and to reach its financial goals.

An investor shouldn’t put all its investments into a single investment but rather distribute the risks by investing in diverse resources to maximise returns while minimising risk. Although stocks are the leading investment vehicle, investing in commodities such as gold and oil has historically ensured great returns.

Investgenics has a solid reputation for accurately forecasting stocks and commodity-based investments, leveraging descriptive and diagnostic analytics. The firm has a robust Python architecture that will let you perform analysis with increased efficiency and productive application across various sources of data that would provide a well-rounded answer to the business objectives.
